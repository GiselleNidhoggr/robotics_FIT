# Purpose 

This project aim to develop knowledge obtained by the completion of the following courses:

- Computer vision guided robotics
- Humanoid robotics

The course was provided by [FIT - Technology Institute](https://www.fit-tecnologia.org.br/) and ministrated by [Joao Augusto](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joaoaugustoluiz/).

## Main Knowledge Acquire 

Below is a brief summary of the subjects studied.

### Computer vision guided 

- Basic concepts of an industrial robot
- Introduction to RC software (Epson RC+)
- Industrial robot motion and power concepts
- Digital input and output commands in industrial robots
- Loops and functions in the program
- Robot tool orientation and relative coordinate system
- Image recognition and positioning correction
- Separation of parts and decision making by image
- Integration with third-party software

### Humanoid robotics

- Introduction to Humanoid Robotics
- Artificial Intelligence applied to Robotics
- Installing Choregraphe, humanoid robot app and syntax
- Getting to know the Choregraphe interface
- Dialog creation and use of tools and functions

In this section, is possible to observe the flow to create a chat bot and using the software Choregraphe, develop a real chat with the robot, as the following image:

 Regardless the complexity, the main challenge was to make the real NAO robot to interact in real time. Is possible to check the [`code here`](https://github.com/GiselleNidhoggr/robotics_FIT/blob/main/RoboticaHumanoide/Class3_Project_NAO_ChildDialog/code/ChildDialog_enu.top) .
  
 Bellow is possible to watch a third party person (Jo√£o) interacting with the NAO Robot, using the code I created. (Click on the image)

  Feel free to check the files on this project, as there's many other activities related to robotics.
